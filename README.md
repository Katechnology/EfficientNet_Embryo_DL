#### Abstract: In this study, we proposed a Deep Learning-based approach to embryo quality assessment at early stage (cleavage) and blastocyst stage. We acknowledged that this is the first work conducted utilizing data from a Vietnam hospital with the stated aim in both day 3 and day 5 image data. Our experimental results conclusively show that the proposed approaches significantly outperformed traditional classification methods, surpassing them by a margin of at least 9.3% and thereby won the annual international competition in ISODSâ€™s Kaggle challenge 2023
